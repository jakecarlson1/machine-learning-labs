    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "For this lab, we will again be examining the Global Terrorism Database maintained by the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START) at the University of Maryland. We will be looking at attacks that happened in the United States over the whole time span of the data set, since it's creation in 1974.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Business Understanding\n",
    "Local law enforcement running simulations of next possible attack?\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on characteristics of the attack, we want to be able to determine the (attack type/target type) that is to be targeted.\n",
