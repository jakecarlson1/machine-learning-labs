    "# Lab 4 - Extending Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "### Eric Smith and Jake Carlson\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "For this lab, we will again be examining the Global Terrorism Database maintained by the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START) at the University of Maryland. We will be looking at attacks that happened in the United States over the whole time span of the data set, since it's creation in 1974.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be extending binary logistic regression based classification to support multiple classes. Specifically, based on the attributes of the input entity, we want to predict what the attack type of the entity is.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Business Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "### Motivations\n",
    "Protecting the United States from terror threats has been a major objective of the federal government. This is characterized by the founding of the Department of Homeland Security in 2001. But predicting when an attack will happen based on certain attributes is next to impossible. Attempting to train a model on the Global Terrorism Database to learn when terrorist attacks happen will result in a model that is over-trained on the GTD and will fail to predict any such attacks. Not to mention, such a system would have to be accompanied by a large-scale communication monitoring and processing system capable of feeding the model relevant inputs that exemplify a possible attack.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of trying to predict when an attack will happen, our goal is to create a model that can predict the cost associate with an individual attack. Immediately after an attack has happened, law enforcement can feed in information about the attack, such as the attack type, the number of people injured, and the target type, and they could receive an approximation of the amount of property damage dealt to their city. Such a model would allow city officials and law enforcement to estimate in real time how much an attack will cost their city. Knowing the estimated cost would enable city officials to determine if they need to request support from the federal government in a shorter timeframe. Furthermore, cities could plan their future budgets accordingly to incorporate funding in response to a terrorist attack.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cities have to submit requests to FEMA for non-disaster grants to aid in the prevention and response to terrorist activity. The Department of Homeland Security can also issue grants to aid in the prevention of terrorism. Grant policies start with Congress allocating funds for federal grants of this type. The Executive Branch provides input for how the policy should be implemented. Then grant issuing agencies develop their own policies for how to allocate grant money.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each state defines their own thresholds for when an attack is severe enough that they will ask for federal assistance. Our model will allow officials to immediately decide if they need to file for a federal grant. Smaller cities have lwoer thresholds and larger cities can handle higher costs before needing assistance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "Based on the characteristics of an attack, such as the target type and the date, we want to assign an estimated cost label to the entity. Because our system will be used to estimate the cost for local city governements, perfect classification of cost is not required. However, it is important that these estimations are as accurate as possible because a request for a grant will need to be formed and sent to the federal government.\n",
    "\n",
    "...\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Preparation\n",
    "Here is the list of attributes we will keep in our data set to use for classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### General Information\n",
    "- **year** (ordinal): The year the event occured in\n",
    "- **month** (ordinal): The month the event occured in\n",
    "- **day** (ordinal): The day the event occured in\n",
    "- **extended** (nominal/binary): 1 if the incident was longer than 24 hours, 0 otherwise\n",
    "    - **resolution** (ordinal): The date an extended incident was resolved if *extended* is 1\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **inclusion criteria** (nominal/binary): There are three inclusion criteria where a 1 indicates the event meets that criteria\n",
    "    - **crit1**: Political, economic, religious, or social goal\n",
    "    - **crit2**: Intention to coerce, intimidate, or publicize\n",
    "    - **crit3**: Outside international humanitarian law\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Location\n",
    "We will provide the name of the city to the model. An alternative method would be to train a unique logistic regression algorithm for each city where our system is deployed.\n",
    "- **city** (text): Name of the city in which the event occured\n",
    "- **vicinity** (nominal/binary): A 1 indicates the event occured in the immediate vicinity of *city*, 0 indicates the even occured in *city*\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Attack Type\n",
    "The most severe method of attack. This will be our class label. Although the original data set contains columns for three different attack types, the attack types are ranked by their severity. Many attacks only have one attack type. By removing the second and third attack types from our data set, we will still be predicting the most severe of the attack types.\n",
    "- **attacktype1, attacktype1_txt** (ordinal): Most severe attack type\n",
    "\n",
    "- The attack types follow the following hierarchy:\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Perpetrator Information\n",
