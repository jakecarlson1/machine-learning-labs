    "# Lab 1 - Exploring Table Data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Eric Smith and Jake Carlson\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "The Global Terrorism Database exists as a repository of all criminal activity deemed 'terrorism' between 1970 and 2016. The data set is currently maintained by the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START) at the University of Maryland, but several other groups have been responsible for collecting the data in the database since it began in 1970. The raw data set has ~170,000 events in it. For this lab we will specifically be exploring events which happened in the United States, totaling 2,758 events.\n",

    "### Motivations\n",
    "An active investigation into an act of terror is a hectic time for local and federal investigators. It would be useful if there was a tool that investigators could feed current events into to help narrow the investigation. Specifically, based off of the attack type, location, time, etc., we want to be able to predict what group or type of individual is responsible for carrying out the attack. If an attack has been conducted and the perpetrator is still at large, anything that can be done to reduce the time to apprehend the criminal will increase the security of the targeted community and increase confidence in local and federal law enforcement. A second goal we want to achieve with this data set is determining what areas are likely to be targeted again in the future based off of past events. This information would be useful in planning police presence and urban development.\n",
