# Machine Learning Labs
Labs for CSE 5324 - Machine Learning in Python

## Lab 1 - Exploring Table Data
Exploring the global terrorism database for features and relationships that could be useful to law enforcement in the middle of an investigation into a terror threat.

## Lab 2 - Exploring Text Data
Looking at Stack Overflow questions and answers for properties of a question that result in shorter answer times.

## Lab 3 - Exploring Image Data
Exploring CIFAR-10 images of cars and trucks for distinguishing features between the two classes of images. We perform dimensionality reduction on the data set using PCA and Kernel PCA. We also compare Daisy and Gabor Kernels feature extraction methods to determine which is better suited for our data set.


## ICA 1
Using numpy and scikit-learn to perform linear classification.
